# RaspberryHomeProject (~2018)

The Rasperry Home project was my first contact with Python and the Rasperry Pi.
At that time, it consisted of two motion detectors in addition to the Raspberry Pi, which together with
a light sensor were responsible for activating some LEDs in the dark and
a relay to boot the Rasperry by pressing a button.
It was also possible to play and continue a Youtube playlist for 30 minutes by pressing a button.
