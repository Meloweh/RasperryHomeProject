# RaspberryHomeProject (~2018)

The Rasperry Home project was my first contact with Python and the Rasperry Pi.
At that time, it consisted of 
- two motion detectors 
- a Raspberry Pi
- a light sensor responsible
- some LEDs
- a relay as a power safing strategy.
A motion and light sensor controlled night light functionality was implemented.
I also added the feature to play and continue a Youtube playlist for 30 minutes by pressing a button only.
